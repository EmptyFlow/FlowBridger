# FlowBridger

Console application for generate source code for dynamically linking library.

## Main purpose of application

If you want to create your own dynamic libraries in C#, you may find that it requires a fair amount of boilerplate. To simplify this process, FlowBridger was created and will help generate generic code, not only in C# Sharp, but also in C++ and, hopefully, other languages.
